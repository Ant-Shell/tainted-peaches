### Challenges: <a name="challenges"></a>
* This project brought many challenges, as it was our first deep-dive into creating a working app using the React framework. We learned new concepts and how the flow of React works with class and functional based components. 
* We implemented new and unfamiliar methods within our app, and learned how these methods worked within the framework to make an app come to life. We also saw the vast difference with the intuitiveness of React, compared to the long-winded and drawn out functionality we created in previous apps using Vanilla JavaScript.

### Reflections: <a name="reflections"></a>
* This project was a great learning experience to further solidify the concepts and the in’s and out’s of React.
* Passing props between components is a learning curve, but awesome once you get the hang of it.
